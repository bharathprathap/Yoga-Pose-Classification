A deep learning model that classifies yoga poses effectively using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) by learning from a collection of input images.

This was a project done as part of Deep Learning for Computer Vision course at my university. The project was accomplished using 2 different deep learning methods: 

1) Feed Forward Network
2) Convolutional Neural Network

So in this repository, you will be able see:

## Dataset
The model developed for the objective was trained using
the ’Yoga Pose Image classification dataset’ from Kaggle.
Data augmentation was performed on the dataset at later
stages.
