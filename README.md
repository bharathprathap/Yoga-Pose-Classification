A deep learning model that classifies yoga poses effectively using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) by learning from a collection of input images.

This was a project done as part of Deep Learning for Computer Vision course at my university. The project was accomplished using 2 different deep learning methods: 

1) Feed Forward Network
2) Convolutional Neural Network

So in the Project Source Code Folder , you will be able see:
```
├── Project Source Code
    ├── Phase_1_Feedforward[Source_code].ipynb
    └── Phase_2_CNN_Efficientnet[Source_code].ipynb
    └── Phase_2_CNN_Efficientnet[Source_code].ipynb
```
## Dataset
The model developed for the objective was trained using
the ’Yoga Pose Image classification dataset’ from Kaggle.
Data augmentation was performed on the dataset at later
stages.
